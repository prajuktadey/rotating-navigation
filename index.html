        <h1>The Wizarding World of Harry Potter</h1>
        <small>Prajukta Dey</small>
        <p>The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is a chain of themed areas at Universal Parks & Resorts based on the Harry Potter media franchise, adapting elements from the Warner Bros.' film series and original novels by J. K. Rowling. The areas were designed by Universal Creative from an exclusive license with Warner Bros. Entertainment.A Harry Potter-themed attraction at either a Disney or Universal park was rumored in 2003.However, the rights to the Harry Potter franchise had been acquired by Warner Bros., who denied all rumors. Both Disney and Universal entered bidding negotiations with Warner Bros. and Rowling for the theme park rights to Harry Potter. In 2004, Rowling signed a letter-of-intent with Disney, with the company intending to develop a Harry Potter section within an area of Fantasyland at the Magic Kingdom park at Walt Disney World. On January 2007, About.com reported a rumor from a "highly credible source" that the Islands park's Lost Continent area was going to be re-themed "to the stories and characters of one of the most popular children's franchises". Other sources followed up in the next few days with unofficial confirmation that the new area would involve Harry Potter. On May 31, 2007, Universal, in partnership with Warner Bros., officially announced The Wizarding World of Harry Potter would be added to Islands of Adventure.</p>

        <h3>Charms</h3>
        <p>A Charm, also known as an Enchantment, was a spell that added certain properties to an object or individual. Charms were distinguished from transfiguration spells in that a charm added or changes properties of an object; it focused on altering what the object did as opposed to what the object was.</p>
        <h3>Defense Against The Dark Arts</h3>
        <p>Defence Against the Dark Arts (abbreviated as DADA) was a subject taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. In this class, students studied and learnt how to defend themselves against all aspects of the Dark Arts, including dark creatures, curses, hexes and jinxes (dark charms), and duelling.</p>
        <h3>Potions</h3>
        <p>Potions was a core class and subject taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry[3][10] and Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. In this class, students learnt the correct way to brew potions.[3] They followed specific recipes and used various magical ingredients to create potions, starting with simple ones and moving to more advanced ones as they progressed in knowledge.[3] A standard potions kit included plant ingredients such as Belladonna,[7] and supplies such as glass phials and weighing scales, along with a standard cauldron that all students were expected to bring with them to lessons.</p>
